      " The provided text describes a dual contouring method for Hermite data, but it doesn't offer a direct algorithm for applying it to a specific function like the circle x² + y² = 2.5².  However, we can outline the steps based on the description:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Create a signed distance field:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Discretize the space:** Create a grid covering the area containing the circle.  The resolution of the grid will determine the accuracy of the final contour.\n",
      "* **Evaluate the function:** For each grid cell (cube), determine whether it's inside or outside the circle by evaluating the function x² + y² - 2.5² at the cell's center (or corners).  A positive value means outside, a negative value means inside.  Store this as a signed distance value (positive distance for outside points, negative for inside points).  Alternatively, you can simply store a sign (+1 or -1).\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Identify sign changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Edge traversal:** For each edge of each grid cell, check if the signed distance values at the edge's endpoints have different signs. This indicates that the circle intersects the edge.\n",

      "**3. Compute Hermite data (intersection points and normals):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Intersection point:** For each edge with a sign change, find the precise intersection point of the circle and the edge using a root-finding method (e.g., bisection).  This will be the exact intersection point of the circle with that edge.\n",
      "* **Normal vector:** At each intersection point, calculate the normal vector to the circle. This is simply the normalized vector from the center of the circle (0,0) to the intersection point.\n",

      "\n",
      "**4. Apply Dual Contouring:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Quadratic Minimization (Step 1 of the algorithm):** For each cube with at least one sign change on its edges (meaning the circle passes through it), fit a quadratic function to the Hermite data (intersection points and normals) associated with the edges of that cube. Find the minimum of this quadratic function. This minimum point will be the vertex position for that cube.  Note that the paper mentions using a numerically stable representation for the quadratic error function, which is crucial for robust results.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Mesh Generation (Step 2 of the algorithm):** Connect the vertices generated in the previous step to form a polygon mesh. The connectivity is determined by the adjacency of the cubes.  The details of how these vertices are connected are not explicitly given in your provided text, but would typically involve connecting vertices from cubes that share faces.\n",
